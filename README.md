# Molecular Dynamics Simulation using Google Colab
## Building Gromacs/NAMD (Open Source) with GPU Support on Google Colab

Use notebook.ipynb file to execute code to build gromacs on google colab's ubuntu environment with GPU RunTime turned on.

## Running an example on google colab (May be without GPU support)

Run a simple tutorial by copying pasting the text of MDTutorialFirst.ipy on google colab notebook. Basic commands to help you get simple understanding on running simple simulations.

## Useful options

* ```-nb gpu``` : to run with GPU
* ```-noappend``` : ?
* ```-cpi CHECKPOINT_FROM_DEFFNAME``` : ?
* ```-maxh HOURS_IN_INT``` : Numbers of hours to execute, terminate yourself before colab terminates it to avoid loss of data or file corruptions

## Plotting Graphs in R and Python

* Python - Convert xvg to csv and/or to plot directly
* R - Directly plot using R
