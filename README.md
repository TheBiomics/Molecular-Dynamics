# Molecular Dynamics Simulation using Google Colab

## Building Gromacs/NAMD (Open Source) with [GPU Support on Google Colab](https://www.scientificreporters.com/tool/gromacs-installation-with-gpu.html)

Use *.ipynb file to execute code to build gromacs on google colab's ubuntu environment with GPU RunTime turned on.

## Useful options

* ```-nb gpu``` : to run with GPU
* ```-noappend``` : ?
* ```-cpi CHECKPOINT_FROM_DEFFNAME``` : ?
* ```-maxh HOURS_IN_INT``` : Numbers of hours to execute, terminate yourself before colab terminates it to avoid loss of data or file corruptions

## Plotting Graphs in R and Python

* Python - Python based Utility has been moved to [seperate repository](https://github.com/TheBiomics/GMXvg) with executable files.
* R - Directly plot using R
